                Spotify was founded in 2006 in Stockholm, Sweden,by Daniel Ek, former CTO of Stardoll, and Martin Lorentzon, co-founder of Tradedoubler.
                According to Ek, the company's title was initially misheard from a name shouted by Lorentzon. 
                Later they conceived a portmanteau of "spot" and "identify".
